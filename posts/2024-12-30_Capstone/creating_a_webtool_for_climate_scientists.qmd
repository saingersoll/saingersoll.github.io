title: "Creating a Climate Modeling Web Tool for NCAR Climate & Global Dynamics Lab"
description: "This post details my Master in Environmental Data Science ('MEDS') Capstone Project, Understanding the Influence of Parameter Value Uncertainty on Climate Model Output: Developing an Interactive Dashboard, and explains all of the jargon above. The duration of the project was completed during my time at the Bren School, UCSB and lasted from Jan. ‘24 till June ‘24. Our client & advisor for this project was NCAR Climate & Global Dynamics Lab’s, Dr. Daniel Kennedy. Our objective was to create a web tool that provides climate scientists insights into their climate model configurations. Additionally, it was to enhance understanding of how the simulated terrestrial systems are interacting in different situations, alongside the associated uncertainty and accuracy. This is to better calibrate the Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5), and subsequently the land modeling component of the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2)."

### Understanding Climate Models

***Figure 2**: Defining what a climate model is and its components: [[input parameter]{.underline}]{#inputParameters} and [[climate variable output]{.underline}]{#climateVariables}[.]{.underline}*
:::

Climate models are one of the most frequently utilized tools in climate science. In the most simple terms, they employ complex mathematics to simulate different scenarios on Earth (NOAA, 2014). They provide predictive insights into what the future may hold and are a powerful tool used to understand and mitigate potential climate hazards.

![](photos/land_comp_tl.png){width="2282"}

***Figure 3**: Timeline of land surface categories introduction into climate modeling system (Fisher, Koven, 2020).*
:::

There are several components of Earth’s systems to consider when modeling. On the right, we can see the rapid evolution of land surface modeling since the early 70s (Fisher, Koven, 2020). Over the last decade more than a handful of categories entered the world of climate modeling. For each of these model categories, there are a handful of input parameters (e.g. soil texture) and predicted climate variable outputs (e.g. surface temperature).

![](photos/how_cm_work.png)

***Figure 4**: Utilizing the example of soil texture, a parameter with a wide range of varieties available on Earth (e.g. sand vs waterlogged soil), to explain how a predicted climate variable such as surface temperature will vary significantly depending on the input [parameter]{#parameter} value.*
:::

Due to the high variability in Earth’s biomes, there is inherent [[uncertainty]{.underline}]{#uncertainty} when modeling climate predictions (Navarro, 2024). To more accurately calibrate climate models and optimize their predictive [[accuracy]{.underline}]{#accuracy}, the values assigned to input parameters require evaluation and assessment. In order to do so, climate scientists must overcome the difficulties of interpreting the large volumes of convoluted predictions.

### About NCAR Climate & Global Dynamics Lab
:::

#### Climate Modeling Experiment: Parameter Perturbation Experiments (“PPE”)

Our team’s client, [NCAR CGD](https://www.cgd.ucar.edu/) is an Earth system science research center sponsored by the National Science Foundation. Their research aims to increase our understanding of climate variability and climate change. Towards the outset of the MEDS program, myself and a colleague met with a member of the CGD team to discuss a recent experiment their team had conducted, the [Parameter Perturbation Experiment (“PPE”)](https://www.cgd.ucar.edu/events/seminar/2023/katie-dagon-and-daniel-kennedy-132940). Their experiment generated a total of [[10 terabytes of data]{.underline}]{#tenTerabytes}. It utilized the [Community Land Model version 5 ("CLM5")](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018MS001583), the land component of the [Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2)](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2), and consisted of two methods. Our project focused on the Latin Hypercube (“LHC”) approach.

![***Figure 5:** When imagining the method described below, it’s useful to envision a dashboard with several turning knobs [input parameter]{.underline} for each scenario to predict [climate variable]{.underline}[.]{.underline} Art by [Agor2012](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/set-control-panel-elements-spacecraft-technical-1537154573).*](photos/knobs.png){width="420"}

#### Latin Hypercube (LHC)

The Latin Hypercube experiment attains in reflecting the natural chaos of the world by allowing for dynamic changes throughout all input parameters for each simulation**.** No two parameters contain the same input value (Eidhammer, et. al., 2024). However, they all fall within a standardized range of 0 and 1 and are an estimation of accepted values found in nature. In reality, these parameters are ever-changing, making the LHC approach a closer representation to Earth’s systems. Be that as it may, it is just as difficult to interpret. 

#### The Issues

1.  The [[raw data]{.underline}]{#rawData} and metadata documentation was not easily accessible.

2.  Required additional [[wrangling]{.underline}]{#wrangling} and visualizations in order to interpret simulation predictions.

3.  Lacked prediction [[uncertainty measurements]{.underline}]{#uncertaintyMeasurements}, thus inhibiting model calibration.

#### Our Goal

Our mission was to create a web tool that invites discovery, discussion, and innovation amongst climate scientists utilizing the PPE LHC data. Our team sought to deliver:

1.  Descriptive [[metadata]{.underline}]{#metadata} describing the model components and their associated Earth system category. 

2.  Adaptive [[machine learning]{.underline}]{#machineLearning} tools and visualization to display a 1:1 input parameter-climate variable relationship with 3 [[st. dev. of associated uncertainty]{.underline}]{#stdDev}.

3.  Sensitivity visualization capable of ranking each input parameters contribution to the climate variable prediction, alongside a [[cross validation accuracy plot]{.underline}.]{#crossValidationTest} 

4.  Organized and optimized internal data archival system that grows with new user [queries]{#query}.

5.  A [[containerized web tool]{.underline}]{#containerizedWebTool} compatible with [[continuous integration]{.underline}.]{#continuousIntegration}

![](photos/dashboard.png)

***Figure 6:** This is our web tool. On the left is an overview of the landing page with a prediction. The right displays the metadata associated with the categorized input parameters.*
:::

::: {center}
### Our Approach
:::

1.  Create a robust file processing system: specifications include time range, parameter, and climate variable.

2.  Develop an flexible machine learning emulator that can capture the complexity in the data and individually isolate a 1-to-1 parameter-climate variable relationship with embedded uncertainty and accuracy testing.

3.  Provide informative visualizations packaged in a user-friendly web application that requires minimal upkeep.

### Tangible Solutions
:::

#### Optimized Computing & Data Archival Tactics

::: {center}
![](photos/datawrangle.png)

***Figure 8:** Data wrangling workflow, from raw PPE data into tidy data for machine learning analysis. Blue represents the user selected climate variable that was simulated and orange is the collection of accepted parameter values.*
:::

We wanted to make the information relevant to a user’s interest, so options to select a timeline, input parameter, and climate variable were essential. For the query of interest, appropriate weights to the [[temporal dimension]{.underline}]{#temporalDimension} were applied, so that time reflected calendar months accurately. Additionally, [[spatial weights]{.underline}]{#spatialWeight} for [[grid cells]{.underline}]{#gridcell} were assigned according to respective land area. Once wrangled, these data sets were ready for machine learning analysis.

To reduce the computational burden and carbon consumption associated with our web tool, we employed the unique package, [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html). Similar to the traditional idea of preserving, ‘pickling’ is a systematic approach to storing data long-term in a low storage way. The phrase is coined by the package provider. ‘Pickling’ processes high volumes of data files using serialization for fast storage and loading (pickle, 2024). In contrast, ‘unpickling’ undoes this process for quick predictions and visualizations. Whenever applicable, our application stores and retrieves data in lieu of repeating tabulations. As the web tool is more heavily used, the data archive will increase and the overall computational workload will be reduced overtime. 

#### Machine Learning Emulator & Data Visualizations

\*Bare with me, we are entering the densest sections, they contain pertinent details about our model components.\*

#### *Gaussian Process Regression + Uncertainty*

::: {center}
![](photos/datawrkflw.png)

***Figure 9:** ‘Black box’ machine learning workflow displaying the preliminary data visualization outputs.*
:::

The objective when creating our tool was to provide climate scientists visual insights into how interesting certain parameter-climate variable relationships are over time with a [[defined level of confidence]{.underline}]{#definedConfidence}. To interpret the complex PPE data, a machine learning tool with flexible capabilities had to be built to provide insights into relationships and predictive uncertainty. The specific ML tool employed in this case was [Gaussian Process Regression (“GPR”)]{#gpr}. 

In [[layman's terms]{.underline}]{#laymansTerms}, GPR can isolate individual parameters and determine their relationship with a predicted climate variable and the associated uncertainty (Görtler, et al., 2019). It is easiest to consider the [[GPR emulator]{.underline}]{#mlEmulator} as a [[‘black box’]{.underline}]{#blackBox}. The tool itself simplifies the heavy lifting of the scientist by computing a surplus of predictions for a scenario without a defined [[statistical equation]{.underline}]{#statisticalEquation} (Rasmussen, Williams, 2006). It emulates the climate scenario as described by the PPE data. The tool applies [[Bayesian statistics]{.underline}]{#bayesianStatistics} to average the predictions and provide 3 standard deviations of uncertainty. This can be seen above in the regression plot on the left side.

#### *FAST: Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Transformation + Cross Validation Accuracy Testing*

This following feature will allow climate scientists the ability to identify major contributors to specific climate events. Leveraging our machine learning tool, a [[sensitivity analysis]{.underline}]{#sensitivityAnalysis} feature for predictions was developed using a method called FAST, Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Transformation. In the simplest terms, FAST  can isolate each parameter and rank them according to their relative influence on a predicted climate variable. Mathematically, FAST conducts a sensitivity analysis by decomposing the [[variance]{.underline}]{#variance} of the involved components and assigning it accordingly to parameters for a predicted scenario (Fang, Gertner, et. al., 2003). To assess the accuracy of the GPR and FAST predictions, a cross validation test was conducted for each simulation, plotted, and paired with the associated R² value. This is the inset plot seen above on the right.

#### Containerized Web Application with Continuous Integration

::: {center}
![](photos/docker.png){width="690"}

***Figure 10:** Workflow to describe the back-end workflow of the dashboard operating system.*
:::

Our team prepared a maintenance plan for our web tool hand-off. All essential software is embedded within our product. We used the Docker approach to do so and containerize our web app. This prevents any package updates made in the future from breaking our code. The deliverable is currently in the hands of the NCAR Software Team and is awaiting publication. Its future application will lead to climate model calibrations that will contribute upstream to the [Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (“CMIP”)](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip) provided by the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”)](https://www.ipcc.ch/about/).
