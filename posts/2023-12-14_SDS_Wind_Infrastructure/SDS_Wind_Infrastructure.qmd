### **Main Takeaways**

-   **Population Density:**

    A unit increase in population density is associated with a slight increase in the odds of having an operational wind plant. This suggests that areas with higher population densities are marginally more likely to host wind plants and less likely to experience minority holder opinions taking the majority. Therein, as urbanization and population density increase, it becomes increasingly feasible and advantageous for these areas to invest in and support wind energy projects.

-   **Median Income:**

    An increase in median income is linked to a decrease in the odds of having an operational wind plant. Higher income areas show a lower likelihood of wind plant activity, potentially due to different local priorities or economic factors. Uneven socio-economic power-dynamics could lead to minority opinion holders preventing the development of wind power infrastructure, alongside other renewable energy solutions. Overall, this suggests that socioeconomic factors play a significant role in shaping the types of renewable energy projects that are pursued and highlights the need for tailored strategies to address diverse community priorities in renewable energy planning.

-   **Anti-Wind Infrastructure Opinion:**

    Areas with higher opposition to wind infrastructure are less likely to have operational wind plants. This aligns with expectations that local opposition impacts the establishment of wind plants. Therefore, addressing and mitigating local resistance is essential for enhancing the feasibility and acceptance of wind energy initiatives.

### Overview

Spatial Distorted Signalling (SDS) describes the mobilization of minority opinion holders pushing back electorally and promote legislation that aligns with their beliefs. Leah Stokes (et.al) has explored the SDS phenomenon as a natural experiment in her piece, *Electoral Backlash against Climate Policy: A Natural Experiment on Retrospective Voting and Local Resistance to Public Policy* ([2016](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24877466)). The findings in this paper describe that rural Canadian communities had a greater ability to mobilize and organize political push back against majority chair holders in parliament after the passing of legislation which invited the development of wind infrastructure through incentives.

Stokes' subsequent work, *Replication Data for: Prevalence and Predictors of Wind Energy Opposition in North America* ([2023](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/LE2V0R)), further explores variables like political affiliation and local mobilization. This study aims to reproduce these outcomes with U.S. wind plant data to understand how population density, income, and anti-wind opinions impact wind plant activity, providing insights into local resistance and its effects on renewable energy projects.

### Techniques Applied

-   `Single & Multivariate Logit Regression Models`

    Used to estimate the effects of various predictors on wind plant activity.

-   `Logit & Log Odds`

    Provided insights into the relationship between predictors and the likelihood of wind plant operation.

-   `Predictive Probability`

    Used to estimate the probability of operational wind plants based on predictor variables.

-   `Ethical Critiques`

    Addressing limitations and potential biases in the analysis.

#### Limitations

-   **`Omitted Variable Bias (OVB)`**

    The analysis may be limited by omitted variables that could influence wind plant activity. Ensuring the exogeneity of variables is challenging, and logistic regression models do not account for all underlying factors.

-   **`Insufficient Data`**

    The data set may lack comprehensive factors affecting wind plant activity, such as specific local policies or environmental conditions.

### `U.S. Wind Power Plant Data`

-   [Replication Data for: Prevalence and predictors of wind energy opposition in North America](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=7339850&version=1.0)

The data source that was utilized in this project, US Wind Data, focuses on the public stance on wind infrastructure for census tract regions within a 3 km buffer zone of a wind infrastructure project. It contains categorical variables, binary variables, continuous socioeconomic factors such as % of races, % precinct political GOP affiliated voting share, mobilization tactics, and more. For simplicity's sake, we're going to focus on the variables below.

### Read & Wrangle Data

**Converting Vector into Raster Data for Mapping**

Below we will use the package `sf` to convert the lat/long vector data into a raster geometry column. In this single line, we will also be assigning the CRS EPSG:4326 to the sf data frame. Coordinate Reference Systems, CRS, are required in order for the data to be projected onto a map. The CRS was selected because it provides a relatively proportionate display of the United States. We are open to suggestions regarding our CRS if a different project better fits our data.

#### `U.S. Wind Data`

```{r read_n_wrangle_wind_data, message = FALSE}
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# ----        Read & Raster      ----
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# reading in & storing data
wind_data <- read.csv("../data/wind_data/wind_data_usa.csv")  

# Confirm the Data Loaded Properly
#head(wind_data)                  # displays the first 6 rows of the data

# Let's read in our data
wind_sf <- wind_data %>%       
  # creates geometry column with desired crs 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326) 
                                     
# quick CRS check
#glimpse(crs(wind_sf))                  # output should reveal WGS84, EPSG:4326

#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# ----        Check Point!       ----
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Let's stop and see if our outputs are what we expect.
# Were the lat/long columns correctly converted into a geometry column?
# setdiff() is a way to quickly determine the differences between two data sets.

# Sweet! we are looking good
#setdiff(colnames(wind_sf), colnames(wind_data))
```

#### Mapping Wind Power Infrastructure Plants in the U.S.

Before diving in, let's get a sense of where we'll be investigating. Using \`ggplot()\`, we can visualize the locations of wind infrastructure power plants throughout the United States. To achieve a more granular map, we'll need to utilize another data set to create a base layer for our map in order to observe these wind plants with respect to state and county jurisdictions.

```{r map_data, message = FALSE}
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# ----        Map Wind Plants    ----
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# First visual of the U.S. wind data provided by the geometry points
wind_plants <- ggplot(wind_sf) +
  annotation_map_tile(type = "osm") +
  geom_sf(col = 'darkgreen',
          alpha = 0.5,
          size = 3)

wind_plants
```

### Determining the Process

We will employ a series of models to describe the effect of census tract level population density on the operating status of wind power infrastructure. A combination of binary and interaction logit regression will be considered.

The initial model will apply OLS regression, this is really a formality to demonstrate why OLS is not the correct approach for interpreting our relationships of interest. The following will be a model with two continuous variables

#### Regression Model Components

**Binary Indicator Variable will be `status` column: `opertating` is 1, and `not_operating` will be 0.**

These variables focus more on regionally dependent factors that intuitively seem to have an impact on mobilization variables that we don't have time to cover in this project. We'll be working with a mix of discrete and continuous data, so there some wrangling will be necessary to run the regressions we're interested in.

```{r indicator_var_wrangle}
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# ---- Inspect & Standarize Data ----
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Determining Variable Assignments for OLS
#unique(wind_sf$status)     # displays unique values in this

# Need to rename status output variables
# creating two categories: operating & not_operating
# We are removing 'Operating | Decommissioned' because it skews the data
unwanted_status <- "Operating | Decommissioned"
replacement_status <- "Uncertain Status"
wind_sf$status[wind_sf$status== unwanted_status]<-"Uncertain Status"  

# were we successful ?
#unique(wind_sf$status)     # displays unique values in this

# cleaning out NAs for OLS
wind_sf <- wind_sf %>%
  filter(is.na(status) == 'FALSE') %>% 
  filter(is.na(is_anti_wind) == 'FALSE') %>% 
  filter(is.na(pop_den) == 'FALSE') %>% 
  filter(is.na(med_inc) == 'FALSE') %>% 
  filter(is.na(median_age) == 'FALSE') %>% 
  filter(is.na(n_turbs) == 'FALSE')

# were we successful ?
#unique(wind_sf$status)     # displays unique values in this

# if_else preserves the data type but replaces unwanted values
wind_us <- wind_sf %>% 
  mutate(status = if_else(
    status %in% c('Cancelled', 'Out of service (temporarily)', 'Standby', 'Decommissioned', 'Uncertain Status'), 'not_operating',
    'operating') 
  )

# are our only outputs "operating" and "not_operating"?
#print(unique(wind_us$status))

# status as factor and reassigned values
wind_us <- wind_us %>% 
  mutate(status = case_when(status == "operating" ~ 1,
            status == "not_operating" ~ 0))
```

#### Check Point!

Does the binary variable contain only 0s or 1s?

```{r indicator_var_check_point}
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# ----        Check point!       ----
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# are our only outputs 0 or 1?
print(unique(wind_us$status))
```

#### Visualizing the Categorical Response Variable Across a Distribution

Before jumping into any analysis, it's important to get a sense of how the data is distributed and if there are any underlying trends or biases. The two visual aids we're going to create are a violin plot with jitter points (left) and a comparative regression plot using OLS and GLM (right). Combining two figures provides us fuller insights into both the general trend and changes in probability of the binary outcome for the population density predictor.

The visualizations display the majority of the distribution lies within the actively operating wind infrastructure plants. A trend of inactive plants and lower population density is notable in both figures. Collectively they demonstrate smaller population densities contain more inactive wind infrastructure plants. This could be attributed to with weight of a singular vote in regions with smaller demographics.

Local mobilization of minority opinion holders in these regions have a greater availability to push back against policymakers. However, this visual does not encapsulate all of the necessary information required to determine this with full certainty. Our data set has low availability for non-operating infrastructure and as such, in the regression figure on the right these are being treated as outliers.

In Table 2, the intercept has a log-odds of `3.272` is noted a statistically significant value (p-value \< 0.01). This value provides insights into the baseline probability of the outcome when all predictors are set to zero. It suggests that the baseline probability of having an active wind plant

In Table 3, the intercept has a log-odds of `4.028` is noted a statistically significant value (p-value \< 0.01). This value provides insights into the baseline probability of the outcome when all predictors are set to zero.

#### Analysis of Log Odds Ratio

In order to calculate the baseline probability of having an active wind plant, the following equation will be applied:

$$\operatorname{logit}(p)=\log \left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)=\beta_0+\beta_1 + \beta_2+\varepsilon $$

it is manipulated to solve for the probability, p: $$pÃÇ = e^(Œ≤0+Œ≤1x1+eŒ≤0+Œ≤1x)$$

To simplify our workflow, we're going to solve for p using the `uniroot`¬†function to find the probability for different values of population density. It allows us to solve for a range of p values using $R^2$.

We're going to inspect the operational probability according to the population density quantile.

The probability distribution of having an active local wind plant across different population density and median income quantiles reveals some notable trends:

-   **Population Density**: Consistent with expectations, areas with the highest population density show the highest probability of hosting wind plants in this example. This trend aligns with the assumption that regions with more people may have a higher demand for renewable energy sources like wind power. Studies have shown, "urban areas with higher population densities are often more likely to invest in environmental infrastructure, including wind energy projects" (Kahn, 2007, p. 58).

-   **Median Income**: Interestingly, high-income areas with lower population densities tend to have the lowest likelihood of having an active local wind plant. This observation is intriguing and suggests that higher income alone may decrease the probability of wind power plant activity. A study on socio-economic dynamics conducted by McCright and Dunlap found "socioeconomic status significantly affects individuals' environmental attitudes and policy preferences" (McCright & Dunlap, 2011, p. 402). Their research suggests that higher-income individuals might have different priorities or less immediate need for such infrastructure compared to lower-income communities.

##### **`Question:`**

Could an assumption be made in which areas at risk of spatially distorted signalling have a greater propensity for higher median income and lower population density?

Let's touch a bit on the social psychology at potentially at play.

-   **Resources and Political Mobilization**:

    -   **Higher Income Brackets**: Addressing this question involves considering the impact of political and economic influence on energy policy. Verba, Schlozman, and Brady argue that "higher-income individuals typically have more resources and time to engage in political activities, which can influence local energy policies" (Verba, Schlozman, & Brady, 1995, p. 234). This might suggest that wealthier areas could exert more influence to prioritize different energy investments or limit the visibility of such projects.

    -   **Lower Income Brackets**: Conversely, those in lower income brackets may have fewer resources and less time for such activities, potentially resulting in lower levels of wind plant advocacy and adoption.

-   **Donations and Lobbying**:

    -   High-income individuals or entities may make substantial donations to lobbying groups or political campaigns to promote specific agendas, including energy policies that align with their interests. Hertel and Tsigas highlight that "financial contributions and lobbying play a significant role in shaping policy decisions" (Hertel & Tsigas, 2002, p. 78). This could mean that higher-income areas, with their greater financial resources, might be able to affect decisions on wind plant locations or energy policy. This financial influence can interfere the development and implementation of local energy projects.

-   **Influence of Socioeconomic Status**:

    -   The presence of wind plants might be influenced by socioeconomic status in ways that reflect broader patterns of power and influence. These insights align with the notion that "economic power and market conditions influence decisions related to energy infrastructure" (Kirschen & Strbac, 2004, p. 112). Therefore, it is plausible that higher-income areas might both contribute to and benefit from a different set of energy policies compared to lower-income areas. Areas with higher incomes might prioritize other forms of energy or infrastructure development based on their resources and political connections.

Now that we've explored probabilities for our two models in a systematic way, it's important to have an understanding of these relationships on a continuous scale. To gain a deeper understanding of the logistic regression model, we will leverage the Odds Ratio. We will create a table displaying the Odds Ratio, which quantifies how frequently a binary event occurs relative to its baseline. This approach provides a comprehensive and more efficient way to interpret the relationships between variables in the model.

### Interpreting Coefficients Using Odds Ratio

To better interpret the relationship in our logistic regression model, we will focus on odds rather than probabilities. Although odds and probabilities are often confused, they are distinct concepts that are related through the following formula:

$$\operatorname{logit}(p)=\log \left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)=\beta_0+\beta_1  (Population Density) + \beta_2  (Median Income) +\varepsilon $$

The¬†**odds** of a binary event are the ratio of how often it happens, to how often it doesn't happen. Here, $$\hat{p}‚Äã$$represents the predicted probability, and $$exp‚Å°(Œ≤^0+Œ≤^1‚ãÖx)\exp(\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \cdot x)exp(Œ≤^‚Äã0‚Äã+Œ≤^‚Äã1‚Äã‚ãÖx) $$ denotes the odds based on our model.

We will create an `odds_hat` variable to represent the predicted odds. The **odds ratio** for a one-unit increase in the predictor variable, x, is given by:

$$
e^{\hat{\beta}_1}
$$

This ratio indicates how the odds of the outcome change with a one-unit increase in x. Importantly:

-   **Interpretation of Odds Ratio**: eŒ≤^1e^{\hat{\beta}\_1}eŒ≤\^‚Äã1‚Äã is the factor by which the odds are multiplied for a one-unit increase in the predictor variable x

-   **Independence from Predictor Value**: This ratio does not depend on the specific value of x; it represents a constant multiplicative effect on the odds regardless of x's value.

Thus, the odds ratio provides a useful and consistent measure of the effect of a predictor variable on the odds of the outcome in logistic regression.

For example, our bivariate model predicts the odds that an area with a population density of 124 ($mi^-2$) and a median income of \$46,094 and would have an operating wind plant is \~97%.

  select(.fitted) %>%
  mutate(Predicted_Probability = scales::percent(.fitted, accuracy = 1)) %>%
  rename("Predicted Probability" = Predicted_Probability) %>%

### Comprehensive Interaction Model Containing Binary Predictor Variable

#### Coefficient and Odds Ratio Table

To interpret the model, we compute the odds ratios for each coefficient, providing insight into how each variable and its interactions affect wind plant activity.

$$\operatorname{logit}(p)=\log \left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)=\beta_0+\beta_1  (Population Density) * \beta_2  (Median Income) * \beta_3  (AntiWindOpinion) +\varepsilon $$

This table provides a comprehensive view of how each variable and their interactions contribute to the likelihood of wind plant activity, facilitating a better understanding of the model's results.

-   Main Effects: The odds ratios for pop_den, med_inc, and is_anti_wind indicate the individual effects of each variable on the likelihood of having an active wind plant.
-   Interaction Effects: The interaction terms show how the relationship between each pair of variables influences the odds of wind plant activity. For instance, the interaction between pop_den and med_inc captures how the effect of population density on wind plant status changes with median income.

```{r comprehensive_model}
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# ----     Comprehensive Model   ----
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Fit the comprehensive model
comprehensive_model <- glm(status ~ pop_den * med_inc * is_anti_wind,
                           data = wind_us,
                           family = 'binomial')

  Odds_Ratio = exp(coef(comprehensive_model))

## Interpretation and Social Psychology

### Resources and Political Mobilization

-   **Higher Income Brackets**: Wealthier areas may exert more influence on energy policies due to their resources, potentially impacting local energy investments.

-   **Lower Income Brackets**: Individuals in lower income brackets may have less influence and lower advocacy for wind infrastructure.

### Donations and Lobbying

-   **Financial Influence**: Higher-income areas may use their financial resources to affect energy policy decisions, potentially hindering wind infrastructure development.

### Influence of Socioeconomic Status

-   **Economic Power**: Areas with higher incomes might prioritize different types of energy investments based on their resources and political connections.

### Our Findings

Our analysis of wind plant activity using logistic regression models has provided valuable insights into the factors influencing the presence of operational wind plants.

#### Main Takeaways

**Population Density:**

A unit increase in population density is associated with a slight increase in the odds of having an operational wind plant. This suggests that areas with higher population densities are marginally more likely to host wind plants. Areas with higher population density often have increased energy consumption due to higher demand for residential, commercial, and industrial energy (Gillingham, Stock, 2018). This increased demand may drive investment in energy infrastructure, including renewable sources such as wind power (Lund, Mathiesen, 2009). Therein, as urbanization and population density increase, it becomes increasingly feasible and advantageous for these areas to invest in and support wind energy projects.

**Median Income:**

An increase in median income is linked to a decrease in the odds of having an operational wind plant. Higher income areas show a lower likelihood of wind plant activity, potentially due to different local priorities or economic factors. Previous studies have found that wealthier communities often have different priorities or face different economic constraints, which can affect their engagement with renewable energy projects (Stokes & Breetz, 2018). Higher-income areas may have more access to alternative energy solutions or face less immediate pressure to implement wind infrastructure. Wealthier communities may prioritize different types of renewable energy projects based on their specific economic and environmental goals. They may invest in more adaptable or luxury technologies rather than large-scale wind projects (Wolsink, 2007). Overall, this suggests that socioeconomic factors play a significant role in shaping the types of renewable energy projects that are pursued and highlights the need for tailored strategies to address diverse community priorities in renewable energy planning.

**Anti-Wind Infrastructure Opinion:**

Public opposition is an influencing factor in the siting and development of wind energy projects. Areas with higher opposition to wind infrastructure are less likely to have operational wind plants. Community opposition is a well-documented barrier to wind energy deployment, local resistance can severely impact the implementation of wind energy projects (Krohn & Damborg, 1999). This is supported by other studies that show community attitudes play a crucial role in the success of wind projects, with higher opposition correlating with reduced likelihood of project success (Wolsink, 2007). Therefore, addressing and mitigating local resistance is essential for enhancing the feasibility and acceptance of wind energy initiatives.

Model Performance:

**P-Values**: The p-values for the majority of the coefficients in our models were above the significance level of 0.05. This indicates that while our models show some trends, the results are not statistically significant enough to make strong conclusions. The lack of significance suggests that there may be insufficient evidence to definitively assess the impact of these variables on wind plant activity.However, the intercept provided a baseline log-odds of having an operational wind plant fell within the range of approximately 60% for observations in this data set. The gaps within the data for areas without operating wind plants result in heavy bias towards operating wind plants.

#### Future Works Considerations

If given the opportunity, I would expand the dataset to include any more possible non-operational wind plants and explore in greater detail how exogenous our variables are and determine which values are likely interacting, to produce the best model fit. By expanding the dataset and refining the model, we can better understand the dynamics influencing the operational status of wind plants and make more informed conclusions. Additionally, I would bolster this analysis by identifying and including relevant variables to address the omitted variables bias present in this statistical exploration.
