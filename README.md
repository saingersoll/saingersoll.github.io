# Hello & Welcome!


Howdy there!
I’m Sofia, it rhymes with papaya (Sof-aya)

People know me as a carbon crusader, an environmental data scientist, and a certified chemist (in and out of the kitchen). I utilize data science to amplify the voices of vulnerable communities to drive sustainable climate-solutions paired with tangible policy suggestions.

Currently, I’m at The 2035 Initiative researching global climate adaptation and resiliency in disadvantaged communities and aiding in the development of an equitable clean energy grid model for CA. I employ techniques like geospatial analysis, and statistics to quantify and visualize diverse sets of empirical research and environmental data to support transformational policy change. 

I am a continuous learner. I actively seek to satiate my curiosity for emerging energy technologies, as well as, strategies to tackle GHG emissions and the carbon economy.

Feel free to explore my website and learn more about me and a selection of my projects. If my content resonates with you, let’s connect and discuss how I can bring value to your team! Please keep in mind, this is the repo to my work-in-progress website. It will be under heavy construction for the next year, so feel free to follow along on my journey to explore HTML, CSS, and all that SCSS has to offer.
