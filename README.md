# Hello & Welcome!

## I'm Sofia Ingersoll ( it kinda sound's lika papaya, Sof-aya Ing-er-saul )

I'm a Masters candidate in Environmental Data Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, UCSB. This is the repo to my work-in-progress website. It will be under heavy construction for the next year, so feel free to follow along on my journey to explore HTML, CSS, and all that SCSS has to offer.
