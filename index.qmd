# Sofia Ingersoll

## It sounds like papaya, Sof-aya Ing-er-saul

Howdy y'all,

I am a Masters candidate in Environmental Data Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. I am a creative strategist who loves tackling the never-ending challenges that come with fighting the good fight for climate change.

You'll find me always carrying a hefty toolbox of analytical techniques applicable to a broad scope of environmental issues. I am devoted to bridging the communication gap amongst scientists, policymakers, and the public by delivering data in an articulate and accessible way.
