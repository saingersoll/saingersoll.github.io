### **Hiya! I'm Sofia (Sof-aya), it rhymes with papaya** ![](images/papaya.png){width="20"}

**I am an environmental data scientist devoted to insight informed action. I aim to bridge the communication gap amongst scientists, policymakers, developers, and the public by delivering information in an engaging and accessible way.**

I was recently contracted as the Project Lead and Geospatial Data Analyst for the *San Bernardino Wildland Fires Project* at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In my time there, I will have the unique opportunity to actively contribute to a forward-thinking project geared towards climate adaptation and local resiliency. I have a learned experience developing geospatial workflows for a variety of geo-data types. As well as a foundational understanding of working with satellite and remote sensing materials, both of which I am excited to utilize. After my time at NASA JPL, I hope to continue participating in projects that elicit real and meaningful change. ![](images/orbit.png){width="30"}
