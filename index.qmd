### Howdy y'all! I'm Sofia (it rhymes with papaya, Sof-aya).

I am a creative strategist who loves tackling the never-ending challenges that come with coding and communicating complex information to an audience with diverse backgrounds. In my free time, I'm a chemist in the kitchen, an amateur Spotify DJ, and a zealous zumba goer. Feel free to explore my website and learn more about me, my work at The 2035 Initiative, and my other projects.

If my content resonates with you, let's connect and discuss how I can bring value to your team!
