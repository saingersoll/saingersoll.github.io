### **Hiya! I'm Sofia (Sof-aya), it rhymes with papaya** ![](images/papaya.png){width="20"}

**I am an environmental data scientist devoted to finding evidenced-based solutions to drive informed action and pave the way to a more sustainable future. I aim to bridge the understanding gap between researchers, policymakers, NPOs, private industries, and the public by delivering information in an engaging and accessible way.**

I was recently contracted as the Machine Learning Data Engineer and Geospatial Data Analyst for the *Los Angeles County Ecological Conservation Project* at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. For this project I will have the unique opportunity to actively contribute to a forward-thinking project geared towards climate adaptation and local resiliency. I have a learned experience developing geospatial workflows for a variety of geo-data types. As well as a foundational understanding of working with machine learning in tandem with satellite and remote sensing materials, both of which I am excited to utilize. My interests lie in strengthening climate adaptation and resilience in vulnerable communities by supporting clean energy, resource management, extreme hazard preparation/recovery, and pollution mitigation projects. After my time at NASA JPL, I hope to continue participating in projects that elicit real and meaningful change. ![](images/orbit.png){width="30"}
