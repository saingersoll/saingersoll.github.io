### Howdy! I'm Sofia (Sof-aya), it rhymes with papaya ![](images/papaya.png){width="20"}

I'm known as a carbon crusader, an environmental data scientist, and a certified chemist in-and-out of the kitchen. I am a recent graduate student interested in strategizing climate and global resilience solutions utilizing GIS techniques. After finishing my undergraduate degree in Chemistry, I moved to Santa Barbara in 2023 to further my education and develop my career path by earning a Master’s in Environmental Data Science with the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, UCSB. At the outset of the program, I also began a student research assistantship with The 2035 Initiative at UCSB. Throughout my assistantship, I gained experience in using various GIS techniques and softwares; troubleshooting and debugging; using HPC environments; and routinely reporting updates to diverse interdisciplinary teams. 

I hope to continue participating in projects that elicit real change, propelling me forward in my career trajectory. At this early stage in my career, I intend to focus my experience as a data scientist on writing policy suggestions for sustainability and resiliency related issues. I am most interested in research related to preparation for extreme climate events, the clean energy transition, assessing public health exposure to pollutants after hazardous events, and resource management.
