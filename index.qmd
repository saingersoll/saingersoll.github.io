### **Howdy! I'm Sofia (Sof-aya), it rhymes with papaya** ![](images/papaya.png){width="20"}

**I am an environmental data scientist devoted to insight informed action. I aim to bridge the communication gap amongst scientists, policymakers, developers, and the public by delivering information in an engaging and accessible way.**

I have very recently completed my year contract as a Data Scientist for The 2035 Initiative. In my time there, I had the unique opportunity to actively contribute to a collection of forward-thinking projects geared towards climate adaptation and global resiliency. I have learned experience developing geospatial workflows for a variety of geo-data types, as well as a foundational understanding of working with satellite and remote sensing materials. I hope to continue participating in projects that elicit real and meaningful change. ![](images/orbit.png){width="30"}
