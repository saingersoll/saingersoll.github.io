Leah Stokes (et.al) has explored the SDS phenomenon as a natural experiment in her piece, Electoral Backlash against Climate Policy: A Natural Experiment on Retrospective Voting and Local Resistance to Public Policy ([2016](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24877466)). The findings in this paper describe that rural Canadian communities had a greater ability to mobilize and organize political pushback against majority chair holders in parliament after the passing of legislation that incentivized the development of wind infrastructure.\n\nSince then, Leah has navigated the nuances of varying percentiles in races, political affiliation (particularly the % precinct gop voting share), the scale and size of the project, as well as, the volume of local mobilization in her research, Replication Data for: Prevalence and predictors of wind energy opposition in North America ([2023](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/LE2V0R)). \n\nI am hoping to reproduce these naturally observed outcomes with the US Wind Data and assess the relationship of population density and the project status of wind plants. Analysis of these relationships could provide insight into understanding the scaling effect that local resistance has on spatially distorted signalling in relation to wind infrastructure projects and and sustainable climate policy.\n\nThe data source that was utilized in this project, [US Wind Data](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=7339850&version=1.0), focuses on the public stance on wind infrastructure for census tract regions within a 3 km buffer zone of a wind plant. It contains categorical variables, binary variables, continuous socioeconomic factors such as % of races, % precinct political gop affiliated voting share, mobilization tactics, and more. Data is associated with the *Replication Data for: Prevalence and predictors of wind energy opposition in North America*, [doi](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LE2V0R) Harvard Dataverse, V1, 2023. The collaborators on that project include: Stokes, Leah; Franzblau, Emma; Lovering, Jessica R.; Miljanich, Chris. Leah Stokes and her awesome team gathered all of this information from American Wind Association (awea), operational, Columbia Sabin Center (columbia).\n\n### Main Takeaways:\n\n-   Intuitively as expected, a single unit increase in population density is associated with a minor increase in the odds ratio of a wind plant operating. Our models also described that for each single unit increase in median income, there is a decrease in the odds ratio that a wind plant is operational. Similarly, this is seen with anti wind infrastructure opinion holders.\n\n-   Although our p-values each of our models provided p-values for our coefficients that are hold because they are above the significance level of 0.05. We cannot make any definitive assumptions about our logistic regression models because there is insufficient evidence inspecting the influential effects of omitted variables bias and a lack of data for regions with non-operational wind plants.\n\n-   If given the opportunity, I would expand the dataset to include any more possible non-operational wind plants and explore in greater detail how exogenous our variables are and determine which values are likely interacting, to produce the best model fit.\n\n### Loading Libraries\n\nThe following libraries were selected based on their functionality and ability to optimize our data for mapping.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Loading Libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)        \nlibrary(sf)               \nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(spData)\nlibrary(raster)\nlibrary(ggspatial)\nlibrary(prettymapr)\nlibrary(ggmap)\nlibrary(naniar)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(stars)\nlibrary(devtools)\nlibrary(maptiles)\nlibrary(smoothr)       \n```\n:::\n\n\n# Read in the Data\n\n#### U.S. Wind Data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# reading in & storing data\nwind_data <- read.csv(\"../data/wind_data_usa.csv\")  \n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# Initial Visualization of the Data\n\nBelow we can see the spatial scope of our data being considered.

This is really a formality to demonstrate why OLS is not the correct approach for interpreting our relationships of interest.\n\n### Visualizing OLS of Categorical Response Variable\n\nOur initial visualization demonstrates a correlation between smaller population density and wind infrastructure plants operating. This is likely associated with weight placed on voters in regions with smaller demographics. Local mobilization of minority opinion holders in these regions have a greater availability to push back against policymakers. However, this visual does not encapsulate all of the necessary information required to determine this with full certainty. Our data set has poor availability for non-operating infrastructure, these are being treated as outliers.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](SDS_Wind_Infrastructure-blog_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     Min.   1st Qu.

This visual is very interesting and definitely explains why the $R^2$ value is only giving values in the 0.9 range. Since our data contains a significant number of `operating` wind plants for a wide range of population densities, the regression model is producing a fit according to the `operating` status. The values in the `not_opertating` status appear to be considered similar to that of an outlier.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](SDS_Wind_Infrastructure-blog_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Binary Dependent Variable\n\n$$\\text{status} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{pop_den}\\_i + \\varepsilon_i$$\n\n-   Our summary table describes a null deviance `362.60`.(`1178 df`) and residual deviance `362.22` (`1177 df`).\n\n-   A p-value of `0.593` for $\\beta_1$, is greater than the significant value of 0.05, therefore, the model hypothesis that operation status is influenced by population density holds.\n\n-   However, I am still not convinced there isn't a correlation shared with another factor, so let's explore how our numbers change as we incorporate more variables into our equation later on.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = status ~ pop_den, family = \"binomial\", data = wind_us)\n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

Since we're working with a binomial family, the p-values produced in the `glm()` need to be further extrapolated before they may be used to interpret our model.\n\nOur model that we just fit tells us that:\n\n#### $$logit(p)=log( p / 1−p)=β0+β1x+ε$$\n\nso then, to solve for p:\n\n$$p̂=e^(β0+β1x1+eβ0+β1x)$$\n\nAlternatively, we're going to solve for p using $R^2$ because that looks gross. The `uniroot` function searches over the provided interval to find the zero value of the function provided. We pass the expression that should equal zero, and it finds us the p that ensures it equals zero.\n\n## Finding p\n\nUtilizing the funky relationship described above, we can solve for a range of p values using $R^2$. We're curious about the probability of `operating` wind plants for Population Density at `20,000`, `6,000`, and `600.`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.9989509\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.9872347\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.967067\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nManually computing the probability for different outcomes is tedious and inefficient. To improve this, we can make a table containing the odds ratio of how often a binary event occurs.\n\n## Interpreting Coefficients Using Odds Ratio\n\nTo better interpret this relationship, we are going to change the scale of the variable on the y-axis. Now, we will be considering the odds, rather than the probability. While these two concepts are often conflated, they are not the same\\[[2](https://tcarleton.github.io/EDS-222-stats/labs/06-week-six/week-6-lab-answers.html)\\]. They are however, related by the simple formula below.\n\nThe **odds** of a binary event are the ratio of how often it happens, to how often it doesn't happen.\n\n$odds(p̂)=p̂1−p̂=exp(β̂0+β̂1⋅x)$\n\nWe're going create an `odds_hat` variable for predicted odds. The ratio of the odds *after* a single unit increase in x to the odds *before* that one unit change is equal to eβ1. **Notice this doesn't depend on** x anymore! Therefore, it's a useful interpretation of coefficients.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstatus_popden_predicted_odds <-  status %>%\n  augment(type.predict = \"response\") %>%\n  mutate(y_hat = .fitted) %>% \n  mutate(odds_hat = y_hat / (1 - y_hat)) %>% \n  gt()\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis is an \"odds ratio\", meaning we care about how this number differs from 1. If it's greater than 1, then the odds increase when x increases. Conversely, if it's less than 1, then the odds decrease.\n\n-   By how much does our model predict that the odds of `operating status` will change with each additional unit increase in population density?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexp(status1$coefficients[2,'Estimate'])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1.000179\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Answer:** Our model estimates that one unit increase in population density is associated with a change in the odds ratio of $e^(0.0001793) =1.000179$, or a 1.79e-04% increase in the odds of wind plant having an `operating` status.\n\n## Logistic Model with 2 Continuous Variables\n\n$$\\text{status}\\ = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{pop_den}\\_i + \\beta_2 \\text{med_inc} + \\varepsilon_i$$\n\n-   Our summary table describes a null deviance 362.60.(1178 df) and residual deviance 359.84 (1176 df).\n\n-   Additionally, it provides a p-value of 0.511 for $\\beta_1$, indicating that the hypothesis here is accepted because it is greater than the significant value of 0.05.\n\n-   The p-value of $\\beta_2$, 0.957 is acceptable because it is above range of the significant value.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = status ~ pop_den + med_inc, family = \"binomial\", \n    data = wind_us)\n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

We're here to break the status quo of OLS and train our brains to interpret logistic regressions using the Odds Ratio.\n\nBy including the median income variable in our model and exponentiating the coefficients, we see a huge effect. Areas with an increase in population density observed an increase in their odds of having active wind infrastructure by a factor of 2.48e-04% when controlling the median income. However, the odds of operating status decrease by 1.5e-05 for each average unit increase in median income.\n\n#### $$logit(p)=log( p / 1−p)=β0+β1x+ε$$\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# beta1

However, the odds of operating status decrease by \\~7% for areas that identify as anti wind infrastructure.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# beta1 estimation exponentiated\nexp(status3$coefficients[2,'Estimate'])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1.000076\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# beta2 estimation exponentiated\n 1 - exp(status3$coefficients[3,'Estimate'])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.9390681\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Table of Binary Predictions\n\nWhat do these predictions tell us?\n\nWell, they lend us some insight into whether or not we can definitively predict the status outcome of a region depending on their population density and position on wind opposition. They additionally provide the model fit ($R^2$) value associated with the predicted value.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstatus_binary <- augment(status_3, type.predict = \"response\") %>%\n    mutate(operating_hat = round(.fitted))\n  \nbinary_predictions <- status_binary %>%\n  dplyr::select(status, pop_den, is_anti_wind, .fitted, operating_hat) %>% \n  gt()\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Results Summary\n\nIntuitively as expected, a single unit increase in population density is associated with a minor increase in the odds ratio of a wind plant operating. Our models also described that for each single unit increase in median income, there is a decrease in the odds ratio that a wind plant is operational. Similarly, this is seen with anti wind infrastructure opinion holders.\n\nAlthough our p-values each of our models provided p-values for our coefficients that are hold because they are above the significance level of 0.05. We cannot make any definitive assumptions about our logistic regression models because there is insufficient evidence inspecting the influential effects of omitted variables bias and a lack of data for regions with non-operational wind plants.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I would expand the dataset to include any more possible non-operational wind plants and explore in greater detail how exogenous our variables are and determine which values are likely interacting, to produce the best model fit.\n\n### Considering Omitted Variable Bias (OVB)\n\nNeglecting additional variables without testing is bad practice. Exogeneity is a very difficult OLS assumption to uphold -- alongside a normal distribution of the error mean. A means to determine relationships between variables is running various linear regression models and comparing the $R^2$ value. In this project, we focused our attention on the why OLS was not the analysis method of choice for our relationships of interest. In the instance of logistic regression, a log odds ratio must be taken to interpret each individual variable. There is a strong possibility that the models utilized in this project are not exogenous and require deeper analysis to determine the impact of underlining influences.\\\n\n#### Citations:\n\n1.
