Now, we will be considering the odds, rather than the probability. While these two concepts are often conflated, they are not the same[2]. They are however, related by the simple formula below.\nThe odds of a binary event are the ratio of how often it happens, to how often it doesn’t happen.\n\\(odds(p̂)=p̂1−p̂=exp(β̂0+β̂1⋅x)\\)\nWe’re going create an odds_hat variable for predicted odds. The ratio of the odds after a single unit increase in x to the odds before that one unit change is equal to eβ1. Notice this doesn’t depend on x anymore! Therefore, it’s a useful interpretation of coefficients.\n\nstatus_popden_predicted_odds &lt;-  status %&gt;%\n  augment(type.predict = \"response\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(y_hat = .fitted) %&gt;% \n  mutate(odds_hat = y_hat / (1 - y_hat)) %&gt;% \n  gt()\n\nThis is an “odds ratio”, meaning we care about how this number differs from 1. If it’s greater than 1, then the odds increase when x increases. Conversely, if it’s less than 1, then the odds decrease.\n\nBy how much does our model predict that the odds of operating status will change with each additional unit increase in population density?\n\n\nexp(status1$coefficients[2,'Estimate'])\n\n[1] 1.000179\n\n\nAnswer: Our model estimates that one unit increase in population density is associated with a change in the odds ratio of \\(e^(0.0001793) =1.000179\\), or a 1.79e-04% increase in the odds of wind plant having an operating status."

Investigations have found that this wildfire was the result of a “line slap,” shared between Southern California Edison powerlines during a high wind event that sparked hot materials which ignited a nearby fuel bed Ventura County Fire Department.\nWe are curious about the environmental and health impacts within Santa Barbara County that resulted because of the Thomas Fire. Our investigation will be exploring the Air Quality Index of SB county between 2017/01 - 2018/10. We aim to visualize the fluxuation in particular matter in correspondence to the Thomas Fire using the average over a 5 day rolling window.\nAdditionally, we’re interested in the burn scars remainig within SB County. To assess the environmental damages within the county, we will create a false color image using a simplified collection of bands (red, green, blue, near-infrared and shortwave infrared) from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmosperically corrected surface reflectance data, gathered by the Landsat 8 satellite.\n \nGitHub repository"

    "text": "Providing Security Beyond Housing\nTo provide true housing security to individuals, we need policies to protect our people and work to create vocational schools, mentorship programs, and/or apprenticeship opportunities to help residents find career paths and gain access to high quality local jobs. This can be achieved by partnering with existing local job providers, educational institutions, and public agencies to train community members to enter the job market, obtain high-quality work, and earn a comfortable wage. In order to build a stronger economy, it is essential that the community has a wide range of opportunities and resources available. Strengthening Community Involvement\nCommunity members carry a wealth of insights to help solve local community issues like affordable housing. Working with a wide range of local individuals who represent community groups, industries, and institutions, to leverage the wisdom of active partners in our community will assist in the facilitation of access to fair housing, clean water, air, and green spaces.\nFurthermore, community members need to be notified far in advance when there is talk of a significant local project. The community members should not be forced to rely on a last minute notice as a means to voice their concerns. A trend within research findings demonstrates lower rates of residential displacement when early community collaboration is practiced in the planning process (National Low Income Housing Coalition). Incorporating the community in the planning process not only helps protect low-income or existing residents from displacement and aids in the removal of developer’s ambiguity as they navigate an uncertain planning process. Overall, fostering more support for projects. Ways to Include the Community Working with local residents to research and peer-review housing policies in other areas, and most importantly. Providing an opportunity for early feedback on planning issues that are occurring within the community. Community development staff attend community meetings frequently to allow for more collaborative solutions to issues such as: affordable housing, traffic, overlay zones, density, etc. Organizing with a local educational institution to offer architectural students an opportunity to design housing projects.\nReferences\n\n“2023 State of the Nation’s Housing Report: 4 Key Takeaways.” Cost of Home, www.habitat.org/costofhome/2023-state-nations-housing-report-lack-affordable-housing#:~:text=During%20the%20pandemic%2C%20the%20number,that%20exceeded%20half%20their%20income.

    "text": "Conclusion\nDuring the 2021 February string of storms in Houston, a number of homes were effected by power outages.\nApproximately 168,956 homes were impacted by the blackout that occurred on February 16, 2023. As a result, a variety of individuals were affected by the blackout. An inspection regarding the relationship between Median Income collected from census data and experiencing a blackout. Only 373 homes were unaffected by the blackouts, but a wide distribution of median wealth were inside this categorization. As expected, Houston homes in census tract regions with lower median incomes experienced a greater number of blackouts compared to regions with higher median incomes.\nThis census data is limited to the time the census was recorded and does not contain up-to-date socioeconomic information for every household. Further limitations to this analysis are the visualizations. The data wrangling process utilized operations that altered the geometry of the data. Objects such as buildings were spliced into pieces when combining the data using st_difference and st_intersection. These steps were unavoidable because other functions like st_intersects did not preserve the datums sf sticky geometries and produce a sparse geometry binary predicate list (sgbp). SGBP are not compatible with the type of mapping exercised above and cannot be made into sf data frames."
