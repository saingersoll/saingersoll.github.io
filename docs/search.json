    "text": "On December 4, 2017, the Thomas Fire swept throughout Ventura and Santa Barbara County, CA for 40 days, devistating a total of 281,893 acres; destroying 1,063 structures and claiming two casualties (one civilian and one firefighter). Investigations have found that this wildfire was the result of a “line slap,” shared between Southern California Edison powerlines during a high wind event that sparked hot materials which ignited a nearby fuel bed Ventura County Fire Department.\nWe are curious about the environmental and health impacts within Santa Barbara County that resulted because of the Thomas Fire. Our investigation will be exploring the Air Quality Index of SB county between 2017/01 - 2018/10. We aim to visualize the fluxuation in particular matter in correspondence to the Thomas Fire using the average over a 5 day rolling window.\nAdditionally, we’re interested in the burn scars remainig within SB County. To assess the environmental damages within the county, we will create a false color image using a simplified collection of bands (red, green, blue, near-infrared and shortwave infrared) from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmosperically corrected surface reflectance data, gathered by the Landsat 8 satellite.\n \nGitHub repository"
