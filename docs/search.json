    "title": "Spatially Distorted Signaling: How Opinions Against Wind Infrastructure Delay Our Transition to Renewable Energy",
    "section": "Interpretation and Social Psychology",
    "text": "Interpretation and Social Psychology\n\nResources and Political Mobilization\n\nHigher Income Brackets: Wealthier areas may exert more influence on energy policies due to their resources, potentially impacting local energy investments.\nLower Income Brackets: Individuals in lower income brackets may have less influence and lower advocacy for wind infrastructure.\n\n\n\nDonations and Lobbying\n\nFinancial Influence: Higher-income areas may use their financial resources to affect energy policy decisions, potentially hindering wind infrastructure development.\n\n\n\nInfluence of Socioeconomic Status\n\nEconomic Power: Areas with higher incomes might prioritize different types of energy investments based on their resources and political connections.\n\n\n\nOur Findings\nOur analysis of wind plant activity using logistic regression models has provided valuable insights into the factors influencing the presence of operational wind plants.\n\nMain Takeaways\nPopulation Density:\nA unit increase in population density is associated with a slight increase in the odds of having an operational wind plant. This suggests that areas with higher population densities are marginally more likely to host wind plants. Areas with higher population density often have increased energy consumption due to higher demand for residential, commercial, and industrial energy (Gillingham, Stock, 2018). This increased demand may drive investment in energy infrastructure, including renewable sources such as wind power (Lund, Mathiesen, 2009). Therein, as urbanization and population density increase, it becomes increasingly feasible and advantageous for these areas to invest in and support wind energy projects.\nMedian Income:\nAn increase in median income is linked to a decrease in the odds of having an operational wind plant. Higher income areas show a lower likelihood of wind plant activity, potentially due to different local priorities or economic factors. Previous studies have found that wealthier communities often have different priorities or face different economic constraints, which can affect their engagement with renewable energy projects (Stokes & Breetz, 2018). Higher-income areas may have more access to alternative energy solutions or face less immediate pressure to implement wind infrastructure. Wealthier communities may prioritize different types of renewable energy projects based on their specific economic and environmental goals. They may invest in more adaptable or luxury technologies rather than large-scale wind projects (Wolsink, 2007). Overall, this suggests that socioeconomic factors play a significant role in shaping the types of renewable energy projects that are pursued and highlights the need for tailored strategies to address diverse community priorities in renewable energy planning.\nAnti-Wind Infrastructure Opinion:\nPublic opposition is an influencing factor in the siting and development of wind energy projects. Areas with higher opposition to wind infrastructure are less likely to have operational wind plants. Community opposition is a well-documented barrier to wind energy deployment, local resistance can severely impact the implementation of wind energy projects (Krohn & Damborg, 1999). This is supported by other studies that show community attitudes play a crucial role in the success of wind projects, with higher opposition correlating with reduced likelihood of project success (Wolsink, 2007). Therefore, addressing and mitigating local resistance is essential for enhancing the feasibility and acceptance of wind energy initiatives.\nModel Performance:\nP-Values: The p-values for the majority of the coefficients in our models were above the significance level of 0.05. This indicates that while our models show some trends, the results are not statistically significant enough to make strong conclusions. The lack of significance suggests that there may be insufficient evidence to definitively assess the impact of these variables on wind plant activity.However, the intercept provided a baseline log-odds of having an operational wind plant fell within the range of approximately 60% for observations in this data set. The gaps within the data for areas without operating wind plants result in heavy bias towards operating wind plants.\n\n\nFuture Works Considerations\nIf given the opportunity, I would expand the dataset to include any more possible non-operational wind plants and explore in greater detail how exogenous our variables are and determine which values are likely interacting, to produce the best model fit. By expanding the dataset and refining the model, we can better understand the dynamics influencing the operational status of wind plants and make more informed conclusions. Additionally, I would bolster this analysis by identifying and including relevant variables to address the omitted variables bias present in this statistical exploration.\n\n\n\nCitations\n\nStokes, Leah C., et al. “Prevalence and Predictors of Wind Energy Opposition in North America.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, vol. 120, no. 40, Sept. 2023, doi:10.1073/pnas.2302313120.\nStoke, L.

    "text": "Google earth V 6.2.2.6613. (December 13, 2017). Santa Barbara, United States. 34.6099° N, 120.0665° W, Eye alt 13.72 feet. DigitalGlobe 2020. http://www.earth.google.com [December 12, 2023].\n\n\n\nOn December 4, 2017, the Thomas Fire in Santa Barbara County. began to sweep throughout Ventura and Santa Barbara County, CA. For 40 days, a devistating total of 281,893 acres were consumed; destroying 1,063 structures and claiming two casualties (one civilian and one firefighter). Investigations have found that this wildfire was the result of a “line slap,” shared between Southern California Edison (“SCE”) powerlines during a high wind event that sparked hot materials to ignite a nearby fuel bed (Ventura County Fire Department). As of 2019, SCE agreed to a $360 million settlement to address the conglomorate negative impacts caused by the Thomas Fire, Woolsey Fire, and Koeningstein Fire. As well as, the ripple effect of the Thomas Fire, which was especially felt by community members in January of 2018 when 23 lives were claimed from a debris flow in Montecito (Wildfire Today, California Govenor’s Office of Emergency Services).\n\n\n\nTo get a better understanding of the initial environmental and public health impacts caused by the Thomas Fire, together, we will explore the Air Quality Index (AQI) of SB County between 2017/01 - 2018/10. We’ll quanitfy and visualize the amount of particulate matter seen in the image abouve using both the Daily AQI and the average AQI over a 5 day rolling window in units of ppm. In addition, we will gain insight into what parts of Santa Barbara County were exposed to the Thomas Fire, through the examination of burn scars using false-color imaging on Landsat 8 satellite data from the Microsoft Planetary Computer (“MPC”). We will use a simplified collection of bands (red, green, blue, near-infrared and shortwave infrared) from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmosperically corrected surface reflectance data.\n\n\n\nIn AQI the figure on the left, there is a sharp peak observed the day the Thomas Fire began (Dec. 4, 2017) that fell within the Very Unhealthy category and over a 5 day period, averaged out into the Unhealthy category. This trend can be observed at the noted location in the figure below, indicating negative public health effects on air quality resulting from the Thomas Fire. The figure on the right, displays the large parcel of Santa Barbara County that was engulfed by the fire, explaining the uptake in particulate matter observed in December of 2017. There were significant direct impacts on public health in terms of air quality as a response to this fire and this can be understood when considering the size of the burn scar seen in the figure on the right.\n\n\n\nAQI_Assessment.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectly accessing & processing MPC STAC data\nRaster analysis applying false color imagery\nTime series analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Daily Air Quality Index (AQI) data to quantify the particulate matter released into Santa Barbara County from the fire was collected here from the US Environmental Protection Agency to visualize the rolling AQI averages between 2017 and 2018.\n\n\n\nFor our true and false color imagery, we are going to direct access Microsoft Planetary Computer Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 data. The STAC item utilized for this project is ****LE07_L2SP_042036_20171217_02_T1****. The raster data was collected on 2017-12-17.\nThis data should be used for visualization purposes only.\n\n\n\nThe shapefile of fire perimeters in California were provided by the California State Geoportal.

However,a spike in air pollutants between the months of December 2017 and January 2018 is clearly observed.

    "text": "Google earth V 6.2.2.6613. (December 13, 2017). Santa Barbara, United States. 34.6099° N, 120.0665° W, Eye alt 13.72 feet. DigitalGlobe 2020. http://www.earth.google.com [December 12, 2023].\n\n\n\nOn December 4, 2017, the Thomas Fire in Santa Barbara County. began to sweep throughout Ventura and Santa Barbara County, CA. For 40 days, a devistating total of 281,893 acres were consumed; destroying 1,063 structures and claiming two casualties (one civilian and one firefighter). Investigations have found that this wildfire was the result of a “line slap,” shared between Southern California Edison (“SCE”) powerlines during a high wind event that sparked hot materials to ignite a nearby fuel bed (Ventura County Fire Department). As of 2019, SCE agreed to a $360 million settlement to address the conglomorate negative impacts caused by the Thomas Fire, Woolsey Fire, and Koeningstein Fire. As well as, the ripple effect of the Thomas Fire, which was especially felt by community members in January of 2018 when 23 lives were claimed from a debris flow in Montecito (Wildfire Today, California Govenor’s Office of Emergency Services).\n\n\n\nTo get a better understanding of the initial environmental and public health impacts caused by the Thomas Fire, together, we will explore the Air Quality Index (AQI) of SB County between 2017/01 - 2018/10. We’ll quanitfy and visualize the amount of particulate matter seen in the image abouve using both the Daily AQI and the average AQI over a 5 day rolling window in units of ppm. In addition, we will gain insight into what parts of Santa Barbara County were exposed to the Thomas Fire, through the examination of burn scars using false-color imaging on Landsat 8 satellite data from the Microsoft Planetary Computer (“MPC”). We will use a simplified collection of bands (red, green, blue, near-infrared and shortwave infrared) from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmosperically corrected surface reflectance data.\n\n\n\nIn AQI the figure on the left, there is a sharp peak observed the day the Thomas Fire began (Dec. 4, 2017) that fell within the Very Unhealthy category and over a 5 day period, averaged out into the Unhealthy category. This trend can be observed at the noted location in the figure below, indicating negative public health effects on air quality resulting from the Thomas Fire. The figure on the right, displays the large parcel of Santa Barbara County that was engulfed by the fire, explaining the uptake in particulate matter observed in December of 2017. There were significant direct impacts on public health in terms of air quality as a response to this fire and this can be understood when considering the size of the burn scar seen in the figure on the right.\n\n\n\nAQI_Assessment.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectly accessing & processing MPC STAC data\nRaster analysis applying false color imagery\nTime series analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Daily Air Quality Index (AQI) data to quantify the particulate matter released into Santa Barbara County from the fire was collected here from the US Environmental Protection Agency to visualize the rolling AQI averages between 2017 and 2018.\n\n\n\nFor our true and false color imagery, we are going to direct access Microsoft Planetary Computer Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 data. The STAC item utilized for this project is ****LE07_L2SP_042036_20171217_02_T1****. The raster data was collected on 2017-12-17.\nThis data should be used for visualization purposes only.\n\n\n\nThe shapefile of fire perimeters in California were provided by the California State Geoportal.

However,a spike in air pollutants between the months of December 2017 and January 2018 is clearly observed. The sharp initial peak observed the day the Thomas Fire began (Dec. 4, 2017) caused an inital AQI response within the Very Unhealthy category and over a 5 day period, averaged out into the Unhealthy category.

In AQI the figure on the left, there is a sharp peak observed the day the Thomas Fire began (Dec. 4, 2017) that fell within the Very Unhealthy category and over a 5 day period, averaged out into the Unhealthy category. This trend can be observed at the noted location in the figure below, indicating negative public health effects on air quality resulting from the Thomas Fire. The figure on the right, displays the large parcel of Santa Barbara County that was engulfed by the fire, explaining the uptake in particulate matter observed in December of 2017. There were significant direct impacts on public health in terms of air quality as a response to this fire and this can be understood when considering the size of the burn scar seen in the figure on the right.\n\n\nCode\n#------------------------------------\n#  ----     Customization        ----\n#------------------------------------\n# Define AQI categories and colors\naqi_categories = {\n    'Good': (0, 50, '#00E400'),\n    'Moderate': (51, 100, '#FFFF00'),\n    'Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups': (101, 150, '#FF9933'),\n    'Unhealthy': (151, 200, '#FF0000'),\n    'Very Unhealthy': (201, 300, '#8B0000'),\n    'Hazardous': (301, 500, '#800080')\n}\n\ncolors = {'aqi':'#f69517',\n          'five_day_average':'#360F39'}\n\n# Plot the images in the same figure side-by-side\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, \n                               figsize = (22,8)) \n\n\n#------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Plotting the Daily & 5-Day Rolling Window AQI for Santa Barbara County \n#------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#------------------------------------\n#  ----     Visualizing AQI      ----\n#------------------------------------\n# Plot AQI categories as background colors for associated ranges\nfor category, (lower, upper, color) in aqi_categories.items():\n    ax1.fill_between(aqi_sb.index, lower, upper, color=color, alpha=0.2, label=f'{category}')\n\n# Plot the AQI and 5-Day Rolling Average\naqi_sb.plot(ax=ax1,\n            y=['aqi', 'five_day_average'],\n            color=colors,             \n            ylim= (0,400),\n            legend= True,\n            ylabel='AQI Values (ppm)'\n            )\n\n# applying customizations\nax1.set_title('Air Quality Index (AQI) Assessment of Santa Barbara County 2017-2018', \n             fontsize=21) \n\nax1.set_xlabel(xlabel='Date',\n               fontsize = 13)\n\nax2.set_ylabel(ylabel='AQI Values (ppm)',\n               fontsize = 10)\n\n# Add a legend for background colors\nbackground_legend = [Line2D([0], [0], color='#00E400', lw=6, alpha=0.3),\n                     Line2D([0], [0], color='#FFFF00', lw=6, alpha=0.3),\n                     Line2D([0], [0], color='#FF9933', lw=6, alpha=0.3),\n                     Line2D([0], [0], color='#FF0000', lw=6, alpha=0.3),\n                     Line2D([0], [0], color='#8B0000', lw=6, alpha=0.3),\n                     Line2D([0], [0], color='#800080', lw=6, alpha=0.3)]\n\n# Add background color legend to the plot\nbackground_legend_art = ax1.legend(handles=background_legend,\n                                  labels=['Good', 'Moderate', \n                                          'Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups'\n                                          'Unhealthy', 'Very Unhealthy',\n                                          'Hazardous'],\n                                  loc='upper center',\n                                  bbox_to_anchor=(0.5, 1),\n                                  ncol=3,\n                                  fontsize = 18)\n# Line color legend\nline_legend = [Line2D([0], [0], color='#f69517', lw=2),\n               Line2D([0], [0], color='#360F39', lw=2)]\n\n# Add line color legend to the plot\nline_legend_art = ax1.legend(handles=line_legend,\n                            labels=['AQI', '5-Day Average'],\n                            loc='upper right',\n                            bbox_to_anchor=(1, 0.86),\n                            fontsize = 18)\n\n# Add both legends to the plot\nax1.add_artist(background_legend_art)\nax1.add_artist(line_legend_art)\n\n# Add annotation\nax1.annotate(\"* This peak is a result of the \\nThomas Fire in Santa Barbara.\", \n            xy=(0.28, 0.52), #

    "text": "Providing Security Beyond Housing\nTo provide true housing security to individuals, we need policies to protect our people and work to create vocational schools, mentorship programs, and/or apprenticeship opportunities to help residents find career paths and gain access to high quality local jobs. This can be achieved by partnering with existing local job providers, educational institutions, and public agencies to train community members to enter the job market, obtain high-quality work, and earn a comfortable wage. In order to build a stronger economy, it is essential that the community has a wide range of opportunities and resources available. Strengthening Community Involvement\nCommunity members carry a wealth of insights to help solve local community issues like affordable housing. Working with a wide range of local individuals who represent community groups, industries, and institutions, to leverage the wisdom of active partners in our community will assist in the facilitation of access to fair housing, clean water, air, and green spaces.\nFurthermore, community members need to be notified far in advance when there is talk of a significant local project. The community members should not be forced to rely on a last minute notice as a means to voice their concerns. A trend within research findings demonstrates lower rates of residential displacement when early community collaboration is practiced in the planning process (National Low Income Housing Coalition). Incorporating the community in the planning process not only helps protect low-income or existing residents from displacement and aids in the removal of developer’s ambiguity as they navigate an uncertain planning process. Overall, fostering more support for projects. Ways to Include the Community Working with local residents to research and peer-review housing policies in other areas, and most importantly. Providing an opportunity for early feedback on planning issues that are occurring within the community.

    "text": "Professionally\nI’m known as a creative strategist, an analytics enthusiast, and a certified chemist in-and-out of the kitchen. I am a recent graduate student interested in strategizing climate and global resilience solutions utilizing GIS techniques. After finishing my undergraduate degree in Chemistry, I moved to Santa Barbara in 2023 to further my education and develop my career path by earning a Master’s in Environmental Data Science with the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, UCSB. At the outset of the program, I also began a student research assistantship with The 2035 Initiative at UCSB. Throughout my assistantship, I gained experience in using various GIS techniques and softwares; troubleshooting and debugging; using HPC environments; and routinely reporting updates to diverse interdisciplinary teams.\nI hope to continue participating in projects that elicit real change, propelling me forward in my career trajectory. At this early stage in my career, I intend to focus my experience as a data scientist on writing policy suggestions for sustainability and resiliency related issues. I am most interested in research related to preparation for extreme climate events, the clean energy transition, assessing public health exposure to pollutants after hazardous events, and resource management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEDS Class of 2024 the day of our Capstone Public Presentation! Date: May 2024.\n\n\n\nBehind the Screen\nIn case you were curious about my name pronunciation, (“Sof-aya” like papaya), it’s actually a piece of my family’s history. See, my mom’s ancestors immigrated from Trondheim, Norway and carried a tradition of namesakes. Unlike the typical Jr., Sr., The III, our family skips every other generation. For example, I’m named after my beloved grandmother, Sofia Anne. This tradition’s been in our family for eight generations! Growing up, I didn’t always love having a unique pronunciation, but it’s given me the confidence to speak up and politely correct someone. I love my name, the strength it gives me, and my lineage tied to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is my lovely grandmother, whom I was named after, Sofia Anne. In this photo, we were out enjoying brunch at this tasty place called Madison on Park in San Diego. Date: June 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
