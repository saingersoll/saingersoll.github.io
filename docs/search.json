    "text": "Howdy y'all, my name is Sofia Ingersoll, but you can call me Soapy Soap because Iâ€™m always scrubbing data. I'm an Environmental Data Scientist in training at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. I have experience with creative strategizing and my priority continues to be tidy data alongside quality data visualization. You'll find me always carrying a hefty toolbox of analytical techniques applicable to a broad scope of environmental issues.\nI'm seeking a part-time, entry-level, data analyst position to further develop my coding capabilities and scientific communication skills. I am devoted to bridging the communication gap amongst scientists, policymakers, and the public by delivering data in an articulate and accessible way."
