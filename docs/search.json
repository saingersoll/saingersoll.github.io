    "text": "Providing Security Beyond Housing\nTo provide true housing security to individuals, we need policies to protect our people and work to create vocational schools, mentorship programs, and/or apprenticeship opportunities to help residents find career paths and gain access to high quality local jobs. This can be achieved by partnering with existing local job providers, educational institutions, and public agencies to train community members to enter the job market, obtain high-quality work, and earn a comfortable wage. In order to build a stronger economy, it is essential that the community has a wide range of opportunities and resources available. Strengthening Community Involvement\nCommunity members carry a wealth of insights to help solve local community issues like affordable housing. Working with a wide range of local individuals who represent community groups, industries, and institutions, to leverage the wisdom of active partners in our community will assist in the facilitation of access to fair housing, clean water, air, and green spaces.\nFurthermore, community members need to be notified far in advance when there is talk of a significant local project. The community members should not be forced to rely on a last minute notice as a means to voice their concerns. A trend within research findings demonstrates lower rates of residential displacement when early community collaboration is practiced in the planning process (National Low Income Housing Coalition). Incorporating the community in the planning process not only helps protect low-income or existing residents from displacement and aids in the removal of developer’s ambiguity as they navigate an uncertain planning process. Overall, fostering more support for projects. Ways to Include the Community Working with local residents to research and peer-review housing policies in other areas, and most importantly. Providing an opportunity for early feedback on planning issues that are occurring within the community. Community development staff attend community meetings frequently to allow for more collaborative solutions to issues such as: affordable housing, traffic, overlay zones, density, etc. Organizing with a local educational institution to offer architectural students an opportunity to design housing projects.\nReferences\n\n“2023 State of the Nation’s Housing Report: 4 Key Takeaways.” Cost of Home, www.habitat.org/costofhome/2023-state-nations-housing-report-lack-affordable-housing#:~:text=During%20the%20pandemic%2C%20the%20number,that%20exceeded%20half%20their%20income.

Investigations have found that this wildfire was the result of a “line slap,” shared between Southern California Edison powerlines during a high wind event that sparked hot materials which ignited a nearby fuel bed Ventura County Fire Department.\nWe are curious about the environmental and health impacts within Santa Barbara County that resulted because of the Thomas Fire. Our investigation will be exploring the Air Quality Index of SB county between 2017/01 - 2018/10. We aim to visualize the fluxuation in particular matter in correspondence to the Thomas Fire using the average over a 5 day rolling window.\nAdditionally, we’re interested in the burn scars remainig within SB County. To assess the environmental damages within the county, we will create a false color image using a simplified collection of bands (red, green, blue, near-infrared and shortwave infrared) from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmosperically corrected surface reflectance data, gathered by the Landsat 8 satellite.\n \nGitHub repository"

    "text": "The phenomenon of Spatial Distorted Signalling (SDS) describes the mobilization of minority opinion holders to push back electorally. Leah Stokes (et.al) has explored the SDS phenomenon as a natural experiment in her piece, Electoral Backlash against Climate Policy: A Natural Experiment on Retrospective Voting and Local Resistance to Public Policy (2016). The findings in this paper describe that rural Canadian communities had a greater ability to mobilize and organize political pushback against majority chair holders in parliament after the passing of legislation that incentivized the development of wind infrastructure.\nSince then, Leah has navigated the nuances of varying percentiles in races, political affiliation (particularly the % precinct gop voting share), the scale and size of the project, as well as, the volume of local mobilization in her research, Replication Data for: Prevalence and predictors of wind energy opposition in North America (2023). \nI am hoping to reproduce these naturally observed outcomes with the US Wind Data and assess the relationship of population density and the project status of wind plants. Analysis of these relationships could provide insight into understanding the scaling effect that local resistance has on spatially distorted signalling in relation to wind infrastructure projects and and sustainable climate policy.\nThe data source that was utilized in this project, US Wind Data, focuses on the public stance on wind infrastructure for census tract regions within a 3 km buffer zone of a wind plant. It contains categorical variables, binary variables, continuous socioeconomic factors such as % of races, % precinct political gop affiliated voting share, mobilization tactics, and more.

    "text": "The phenomenon of Spatial Distorted Signalling (SDS) describes the mobilization of minority opinion holders to push back electorally. Leah Stokes (et.al) has explored the SDS phenomenon as a natural experiment in her piece, Electoral Backlash against Climate Policy: A Natural Experiment on Retrospective Voting and Local Resistance to Public Policy (2016). The findings in this paper describe that rural Canadian communities had a greater ability to mobilize and organize political pushback against majority chair holders in parliament after the passing of legislation that incentivized the development of wind infrastructure.\nSince then, Leah has navigated the nuances of varying percentiles in races, political affiliation (particularly the % precinct gop voting share), the scale and size of the project, as well as, the volume of local mobilization in her research, Replication Data for: Prevalence and predictors of wind energy opposition in North America (2023). \nI am hoping to reproduce these naturally observed outcomes with the US Wind Data and assess the relationship of population density and the project status of wind plants.

    "text": "Interpreting Coefficients Using Odds Ratio\nTo better interpret this relationship, we are going to change the scale of the variable on the y-axis. Now, we will be considering the odds, rather than the probability. While these two concepts are often conflated, they are not the same[2]. They are however, related by the simple formula below.\nThe odds of a binary event are the ratio of how often it happens, to how often it doesn’t happen.\n\\(odds(p̂)=p̂1−p̂=exp(β̂0+β̂1⋅x)\\)\nWe’re going create an odds_hat variable for predicted odds. The ratio of the odds after a single unit increase in x to the odds before that one unit change is equal to eβ1. Notice this doesn’t depend on x anymore! Therefore, it’s a useful interpretation of coefficients.\n\nstatus_popden_predicted_odds &lt;-  status %&gt;%\n  augment(type.predict = \"response\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(y_hat = .fitted) %&gt;% \n  mutate(odds_hat = y_hat / (1 - y_hat)) %&gt;% \n  gt()\n\nThis is an “odds ratio”, meaning we care about how this number differs from 1. If it’s greater than 1, then the odds increase when x increases. Conversely, if it’s less than 1, then the odds decrease.\n\nBy how much does our model predict that the odds of operating status will change with each additional unit increase in population density?\n\n\nexp(status1$coefficients[2,'Estimate'])\n\n[1] 1.000179\n\n\nAnswer: Our model estimates that one unit increase in population density is associated with a change in the odds ratio of \\(e^(0.0001793) =1.000179\\), or a 1.79e-04% increase in the odds of wind plant having an operating status."

Areas with an increase in population density observed an increase in their odds of having active wind infrastructure by a factor of 2.48e-04% when controlling the median income. However, the odds of operating status decrease by 1.5e-05 for each average unit increase in median income.\n\n\\[logit(p)=log( p / 1−p)=β0+β1x+ε\\]\n\n# beta1 estimation exponentiated\nexp(status2$coefficients[2,'Estimate'])\n\n[1] 1.000248\n\n# beta2 estimation exponentiated\n 1 - exp(status2$coefficients[3,'Estimate'])\n\n[1] 1.497159e-05"
